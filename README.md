# **Biology Flashcard App**

## **Overview**

This application is an interactive and dynamic flashcard system designed for biology enthusiasts and students. Leveraging the power of Python, Tkinter, and pandas, the app provides a robust GUI to facilitate learning through randomized term selection, efficient data handling, and progress tracking. It employs object-oriented principles and event-driven programming to deliver a user-friendly and engaging learning experience.

Features
Dynamic GUI: Developed with Tkinter, the app delivers an intuitive and responsive user interface, adhering to event-driven programming principles.
Card Flipping: Interactive cards utilize state toggling to switch between terms and explanations on user input.
Data Persistence: Ensures progress is saved using pandas for structured CSV file management, adhering to industry-standard serialization techniques.
Custom Word Sets: Enables tailored learning sessions by dynamically switching between datasets based on user preferences.
Randomized Selection: Implements pseudo-randomized algorithms to ensure unbiased card shuffling.
Encapsulation: Data manipulation and UI elements are encapsulated for clarity and separation of concerns.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language implementing modular OOP design.
Tkinter: GUI framework for an interactive, event-driven interface.
Pandas: Library for data manipulation and persistence using CSVs.
Random: Ensures randomness in card selection for varied learning experiences.
