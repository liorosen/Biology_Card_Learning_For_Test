# **Biology Flashcard App**

## **Overview**
This application is an interactive and dynamic flashcard system designed for biology enthusiasts and students. Leveraging the power of Python, Tkinter, and pandas, the app provides a robust GUI to facilitate learning through randomized term selection, efficient data handling, and progress tracking. It employs object-oriented principles and event-driven programming to deliver a user-friendly and engaging learning experience.<br>

## **Features**
- Dynamic GUI: Developed with Tkinter, the app delivers an intuitive and responsive user interface, adhering to event-driven programming principles.<br>
- Card Flipping: Interactive cards utilize state toggling to switch between terms and explanations on user input.<br>
- Data Persistence: Ensures progress is saved using pandas for structured CSV file management, adhering to industry-standard serialization techniques.<br>
- Custom Word Sets: Enables tailored learning sessions by dynamically switching between datasets based on user preferences.<br>
- Randomized Selection: Implements pseudo-randomized algorithms to ensure unbiased card shuffling.<br>
- Encapsulation: Data manipulation and UI elements are encapsulated for clarity and separation of concerns.<br>
