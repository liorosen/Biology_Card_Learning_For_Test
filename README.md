# **Biology Flashcard App**

## **Overview**

This application is an interactive and dynamic flashcard system designed for biology enthusiasts and students. Leveraging the power of Python, Tkinter, and pandas, the app provides a robust GUI to facilitate learning through randomized term selection, efficient data handling, and progress tracking. It employs object-oriented principles and event-driven programming to deliver a user-friendly and engaging learning experience.

Features
Dynamic Card Flipping: Implements event-driven programming to toggle between a term and its explanation seamlessly.
State Management: Tracks the current state of cards (term or explanation) using flags and automatically updates the progress based on user interaction.
Progress Persistence: Utilizes pandas for reading and writing data to a CSV file, ensuring that progress is saved and resumed across sessions.
Customizable Word Sets: Supports filtering between known and unknown terms or reviewing all terms, giving users control over their study process.
Randomization: Employs the random module for unbiased card selection, enhancing memory retention through unpredictability.
Event Binding: Interactive elements like flashcards and buttons are driven by event handlers for a responsive user experience.
Technologies Used
Python: The core language for implementing logic and managing data structures.
Tkinter: A GUI framework for building a responsive and visually engaging user interface.
pandas: Efficient data manipulation and persistence for user progress tracking.
Random Module: Ensures non-repetitive, random card selection for effective learning.
Key Programming Concepts
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The application architecture encapsulates responsibilities into modular functions, improving maintainability and scalability.
Event-Driven Design: Button clicks and card flips are managed by event handlers, promoting interactivity.
Data Serialization: Progress is serialized into a CSV format, enabling data persistence and retrieval.
Error Handling: Implements robust exception handling to manage missing files or data inconsistencies gracefully.
